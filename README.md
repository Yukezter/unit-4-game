# Star Wars RPG

# Overview
This is a very basic RPG game I built using scss, javascript, and jQuery.

**Each character has the ability to win or lose based on the order they choose to fight the enemies.**
**The user always has the option to restart the game at any time.**

How it works:
* Click a character you'd like to play with to start the game.
* Then click an enemey to fight against.
* Press the "A" or "a" key to attack.
* Enjoy!
