## Star Wars RPG

This is a very basic RPG game I built using scss, javascript, and jQuery.
Clicking a character you'd like to play with will start the game.
Any clicks after that will be enemies.
Each character has the ability to win or lose based on the order they choose to fight the enemies.
The user always has the option to restart the game at any time.
Enjoy!
